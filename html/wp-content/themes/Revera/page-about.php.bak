					<p class="aboutsummary" id="mobile"> <i>Riding The Line</i> follows Kevin and Sean, two college friends who leave their lives in Los Angeles for an adventure on two wheels, making their way from the Pacific coast of Oregon to New York City. Working as a self-sufficient two-man production company, they film conversations with academics, athletes, artists, and characters of all walks of life that they meet along the way, who have found happiness and fulfillment off the beaten path. Woven within the narrative of the two friends' own epic journey, Riding the Line delves into the drive behind unusual endeavors and explores the potential of the individual to create something unique.</p>
